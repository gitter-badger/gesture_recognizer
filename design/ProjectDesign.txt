In gesture recognition using an acceleration sensor, gestures are represented by characteristic patterns of incoming signal data, i.e. vectors representing the current acceleration of the  controller in all three dimensions. Hence, we need a system pipeline preparing and analyzing this vector data in order to train as well as recognize patterns for distinct gestures.For this purpose we revert to the classic recognition pipeline


1.Aquire data
	android-programming
	Communication
	accelerometer
		tcp
		bluetooth
	sending data using an android client
	recieve data at server using python server
2.Data filtering
	dft filtering
		low pass filtering
			ideal filter
3.data clustering		
	kmeans algorithm
		scipy in python
4.ann creation and training
	neurolab python
	creating neural  network
	3 layered
	training
	something like a fuzzy output 
	error checking by own function
	iterative
	save the net
5.testing the system
